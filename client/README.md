Running the Frontend
-------------------

Here are the steps to run the **frontend** (React) setup:

### 1\. Install Dependencies

First, navigate to the `client` directory (where your React app is located) and install the required dependencies:

`cd client
npm install`

This will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

### 2\. Start the React Development Server

To start the React app, run the following command from the `client` directory:

`npm start`

This will start the development server and open the frontend application in your browser, usually available at `http://localhost:3000`.
